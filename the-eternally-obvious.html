        <p class="column obvious-2"><p>In The Eternally Obvious, René Magritte presents a dismembered female nude, a work that shocks with its emotional rawness. The piece is part of Magritte’s exploration of eroticism, juxtaposing objects and figures in dreamlike and often disturbing ways.
            <br>Magritte’s approach marked a shift from visual automatism to illusionistic Surrealism. His use of juxtaposed, unsettling imagery in realistic settings sought to break the viewer's perception of reality, pushing Surrealism beyond abstract expression into the realm of narrative and psychological exploration. His works heavily influenced later Surrealists and surrealist-themed artwork beyond the movement.</p></a>
