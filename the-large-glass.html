<p>Marcel Duchamp's The Large Glass (also known as Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even) was admired by Surrealists for its conceptual complexity and bizarrely juxtaposed, erotically charged objects. This work is considered a precursor to Surrealism, reflecting the movement's interest in provoking thought through absurd and unexpected imagery.</p>
<p>The Surrealists appreciated Duchampâ€™s departure from traditional artistic methods, leading to a deeper exploration of the subconscious and the irrational. The Large Glass exemplified the way Surrealist artists questioned societal norms through visual art, blending concepts of sexuality, objectification, and desire with an unorthodox approach to medium and form.</p>
